<h2>Data Analytics<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Google</span></h2>
<p>2024 | R, SQL, Tableau | <a href="https://coursera.org/verify/professional-cert/95E93PQFBP8N"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certificate</a> | <a href="https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Course website</a></p>
<p>I took this course looking to get a practical understanding and approach to data analytics. I found that I had previously learnt a somewhat significant amount of the content, namely the skills towards Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets and SQL. I'm not bothered as this course is meant to be introductory and should not assume such knowledge in all learners. That being said, I still found the course informative in the data analytic workflow (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, Act) and to pick up Tableau and R as skills.</p>
<p>I would recommend this course if you have little to no knowledge in the items metioned above, as it can feel boring to go over material you already have a grasp on.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Harvard University</span></h2>
<p>2024 | Python, Tensorflow, Natural Language Toolkit | <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/b6b77633-6f2b-4d8a-8e8e-ff1d13e6e791"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certificate</a> | <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Course website</a></p>
<p>Building on the Python I learnt from CS50x, I learnt about Artificial Intelligence (AI) fundementals. This included concepts such as graph searching, minmax, optimisation, machine learning and more. The assignments were practical and showed the uses of AI in various situations, from games to data processing and even sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>My favourite aspect was how they related concepts to practical applications, from neural networks/language processing with ChatGPT, optimisation with AI in games, to ranking heuristics (PageRank algorithm) with Google Search.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Computer Science<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Harvard University</span></h2>
<p>2023 | C, SQL, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Flask  | <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/d7fcb233-ffcc-4b68-84a0-8c56e1b2dbb8"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certificate</a> | <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Course website</a></p>
<p>This course helped me build a strong foundation in computer science fundementals. Taught by Prof David Malan, I found the lectures to be engaging and insightful. The lectures, notes and assignments were all exactly as one would receive taking this course at Harvard. The course provided a broad overview of concepts such as memory management, algorithms, databases and web development.</p>
<p>I'm glad to have taken this course, and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into computer science.</p>
