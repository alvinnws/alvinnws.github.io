<h2>Resume Website</h2>
<p>HTML/CSS, Typescript, Angular, Git | <a href="https://github.com/alvinnws/alvinnws.github.io"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository</a></p>
<p>This project serves several purposes, including a place for me to learn more about HTML/CSS, Javascript and the use of frameworks like <a href="https://angular.dev/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a>. Additionally, the website can serve to host records of my life, whether professoinal or personal. I intend to continue to work on the website, beginning a section for a blog, as well as subpages to detail any larger projects I embark on in the future.</p>

<h2>Advent Of Code 2023</h2>
<p>Python | <a href="https://github.com/alvinnws/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository</a></p>
<p>I tackled and completed the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual programming challenge</a> posed by Eric Wastl, which saw >300k attempts in 2023, but only ~11k finishers. However, I only attempted it after discovering it in June 2024, which is basically the opposite of christmas vibes for most people. </p>
<p>I gained a fair amout of experience from the challenges, from applying various concepts such as flood-fill and graph algorithms to learning incredibly niche concepts such as <a  style="font-weight: normal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pick's Theorem</a></p>

<h2>Line Sticker Downloader</h2>
<p>Python | <a href="https://github.com/alvinnws/Line-Sticker-Downloader"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository</a></p>
<p>This was my first ever program written outside of any tutorials/lessons/etc. Short and simple, it served only one purpose which was to take in the link of a Line stickerpack and scrape the images.</p>
<p>Looking back, there is a lot of improvements to be made, but it served its purpose at the time and I saved significantly more time using this than manually downloading everything, which was good enough.</p>
